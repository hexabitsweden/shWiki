_Searching i tWiki

.In this example we want to search for the phrase "split".
We hit "s" and then we type "split" and ENTER.

,Result: vim

Ok so now we know the phrase "split" could be found i a
wiki named vim. But where do we find vim?

.We hit "s" again and search for "vim".
 
,Result: Linux

Ok lets go to the category "Linux" and, voila! There it is.
The vim wiki. :)
