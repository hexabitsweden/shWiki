Link to existing

If you have a Linux category with a
wiki about bash in it, and now you
want to create a freeBSD category and
link the existing bash to it:

Hit "n" and chose a new name or the existing name.
(In this case: freeBSD). Then on the question about
the new wiki name, type the name of the existing wiki
(In our case: bash).

Later when you go to the freeBSD or the Linux category,
you will se that "bash" is showing on both places
